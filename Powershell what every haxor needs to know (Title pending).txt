Title : Powershell.. what every hax0r needs to know
Expected Length : 40 mins
Abstract :
PowerShell (which now ships with Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008) is
an extensible automation engine from Microsoft, with its own shell and
associated scripting language.
This talk will aim at convincing the audience that they need to add
Powershell to their hacking toolkit.
We will begin with a quick introduction to Powershell to ensure that
everyone is able to keep up with the sections that follow.
We will then examine some "classic" pen-testing tools (from
portscanners to attack-tools), and will demonstrate how their
functionality can be replicated natively with powershell.
We will finally demonstrate Powershells utility on compromised hosts..
(This talk is full of live demos and examples.)



Where to start , Powershell is the answer to something that sysadmins and pentesters everywhere have been requesting for ages,  A reliable way to interact with windows systems without the need for a GUI and to do this repeatedly.
Powershell solves both these problems by giving you access to pretty much anything u can do in windows via the GUI through the command line. Also because it’s a scripting language you can repeat everything you do identically.
So now that you have a basic idea behind the basic concept of powershell ,it’s time to turn things to a more security focused  perspective.
First of all why should you bother learning powershell , well its embedded in every windows 7 installation (from the most basic to the most advanced SKU’s) and in WIN2K8R2. With win7 becoming more and more popular chances are every time you pop a box or scan a network you are going to find one of those 2 OS’s installed. Chances are you have it installed right now :P
So a quick intro to what I am going to be showing  :
1. A quick intro on how to access and use powershell
2. I’ll show you what you can do from a win7 machine , i.e. if its your base OS 
3. I’ll show you what you can do if you gain access to another win7 machine
